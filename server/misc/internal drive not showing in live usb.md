Good — that’s an important clue.
If **BIOS detects the SSD**, but **Lubuntu (or other live Linux)** doesn’t show it in the file explorer or `lsblk`, it means **the drive exists physically**, but Linux isn’t able to access its **partition table or driver interface**.

Let’s troubleshoot this carefully so you don’t damage the data 👇

---

## 🧩 Step 2 — Fixing “Internal SSD not visible in file explorer”

### 🔹 1. Check if Linux can see the drive at all

Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) and run:

```bash
lsblk
```

If your internal SSD is connected, you should see something like:

```
nvme0n1     476G
├─nvme0n1p1  100M
├─nvme0n1p2  250G
└─nvme0n1p3  226G
```

or, for SATA drives:

```
sda
├─sda1
└─sda2
```

👉 If you **don’t see it** at all, continue to step 2.

👉 If you **see it**, but partitions are missing or unmounted — skip to step 4.

---

### 🔹 2. Check if the NVMe controller or SATA controller is detected

Run:

```bash
sudo lspci | grep -i storage
```

or

```bash
sudo lspci | grep -i sata
sudo lspci | grep -i nvme
```

If nothing shows up for NVMe/SATA, it might mean:

* You’re in **RAID mode** in BIOS instead of **AHCI**.

### 🧰 Fix:

1. Reboot → Enter BIOS
2. Go to **Storage Configuration / SATA Mode / NVMe Configuration**
3. If you see **RAID**, change it to **AHCI**
4. Save & exit → Boot back into Lubuntu Live

Now run `lsblk` again — the SSD should appear.

> 💡 This is the most common reason for drives being invisible in Linux live environments — especially on Dell, HP, and Lenovo laptops.

---

### 🔹 3. If drive still not visible

Try:

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i nvme
```

or

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep -i sda
```

If you see lines like:

```
nvme nvme0: Identify Controller failed
```

or I/O errors — the drive may have **filesystem corruption** or a **dying controller**, but it’s still recoverable.

You can try scanning for it manually:

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

---

### 🔹 4. If partitions appear but not in file explorer

Sometimes Lubuntu doesn’t auto-mount NTFS if Windows wasn’t shut down cleanly (Fast Startup / Hibernation).

Run:

```bash
sudo ntfsfix /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

(replace with your NTFS partition name)

Then:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/mydisk
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt/mydisk
```

Now open File Manager → Go to `/mnt/mydisk` and you’ll see your data.

---

### 🔹 5. If it’s BitLocker-encrypted (Windows 10/11)

If `lsblk` shows partitions but you can’t open them, check if it’s BitLocker-protected.
You’ll see the filesystem type as **BitLocker** or **Microsoft reserved**.

You can decrypt it in Windows first, or use tools like `dislocker` in Linux:

```bash
sudo apt install dislocker
```

Then mount using the recovery key (I can guide that step if needed).

---

### ⚠️ Important:

Don’t use **GParted** or **Disks → Format / Create Partition** — you’ll destroy your data.
We’re only inspecting and mounting read-only until it’s visible.

---

Can you please share the output of:

```bash
lsblk
```

and

```bash
sudo fdisk -l | grep -A 5 Disk
```

so I can see whether your SSD is detected at the kernel level?
