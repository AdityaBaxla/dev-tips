Absolutely 🔥 — that’s a smart UX tweak.
Let’s make your `ask` command accept *unquoted input*, like this:

```bash
ask tell me about docker volumes
```

…and it’ll “just work,” preserving context too.
We’ll slightly improve the earlier script to handle arguments cleanly.

---

## 🧩 Here’s the updated version

Open your script again:

```bash
nano ~/ask
```

Replace everything with this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Persistent Ollama chat with natural CLI syntax (no quotes needed)
# Usage: ask tell me about docker volumes

MODEL="llama3.2"
CHATLOG="$HOME/.ollama_chat_history.txt"

# If no arguments given, print last reply and exit
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: ask <message>"
  echo "(Previous context is preserved across runs)"
  exit 1
fi

# Join all CLI arguments into a single message
MESSAGE="$*"

# Initialize chat log if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$CHATLOG" ]; then
  echo "Starting new conversation..." > "$CHATLOG"
fi

# Append user message
echo -e "\nUser: $MESSAGE" >> "$CHATLOG"

# Send entire conversation as prompt
RESPONSE=$(ollama run "$MODEL" "$(cat "$CHATLOG")")

# Append assistant response
echo -e "Assistant: $RESPONSE" >> "$CHATLOG"

# Display latest response
echo -e "\n$RESPONSE\n"
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`), then make sure it’s executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/ask
```

---

## ✅ Now you can use it like this

```bash
ask explain jwt authentication
ask give me a flask example
ask summarize what you said so far
```

You’ll never need quotes again 🎉

---

## 🧹 Optional cleanup command

Add this to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias ask-reset='rm ~/.ollama_chat_history.txt && echo "Chat history cleared!"'
```

So you can reset context anytime:

```bash
ask-reset
```

---

## 💡 Bonus tips

* To use a different model temporarily:

  ```bash
  MODEL=phi3 ask write a haiku about programming
  ```

  (The env var overrides the default.)
* To see your chat history:

  ```bash
  cat ~/.ollama_chat_history.txt
  ```

---

Would you like me to extend this script so it **automatically summarizes older context** once the chat log gets long (so it doesn’t slow down the model)?
